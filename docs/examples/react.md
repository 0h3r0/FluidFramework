# React and Prague

* Using SetState directly
* Using React's hooks API
* GraphQL interface on Prague data structures
* Local vs. Shared state within a React component
* Merging in / working with data from non-Prague sources (e.g. component calls another data source (e.g. a database,
  REST API, GraphQL query) to retrieve some data in addition to the Prague data)
