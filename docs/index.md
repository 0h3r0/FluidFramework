# Prague

Welcome to Prague!

We built Prague to make it simpler for developers to build collaborative experiences using Web technology.

Prague's distributed data structures and accompanying abstractions make it easy to write apps that are collaborative just like you would build single-user applications and experiences. Prague handles keeping your data in sync across multiple clients, so you can focus on your app's business logic. Prague's data synchronization is fast, efficient, and requires very little bandwidth. Prague is extensible, too. You can write components which can be re-used or you can even create new Distributed Data Structures.
