# Prague

Welcome to Prague!

We built Prague to make it simpler for developers to build collaborative experiences using Web technology.

Prague's distributed data structures and accompanying abstractions make it easy to write apps that are collaborative just like you would build single-user applications and experiences. Prague handles keeping your data in sync across multiple clients, so you can focus on your app's business logic. Prague's data synchronization is fast, efficient, and requires very little bandwidth. Prague is extensible, too. You can write components which can be re-used or you can even create new Distributed Data Structures.

## Overview/Introduction

* What makes Prague different?
* Benefits
    * You can focus on your app's business logic; Prague takes care of data consistency between all clients
    * It's easy to build 'version history' experiences with your data
    * Components can be embedded in multiple places; reduce, reuse, recycle!
* Features
    * Runtime ensures data consistency between all clients
    * Data persistence including automatic change tracking for all of your data
    * Data synchronization is ludicrously fast
    * Easy to plug in custom components


## Getting Started

### Build a Component

* Walkthrough of a sample component, created using `yo prague`, along with the source code that the generator creates
* Explain what each piece of the sample does, and link to deeper topics as needed (e.g. Distributed Data Structures)

## Concepts

* This section will contain deeper information about the key concepts that developers should understand to be effective with Prague.

### Distributed Data Structures

* Overview of what a DDS is

#### Map

#### Sequence

#### Consensus Ordered Collection

Package documentation: <xref:consensus-ordered-collection>

### Components and Containers

## Examples

### Using `yo prague`

### React and Prague

* Should include a good example of converting an existing React component to use a Prague data model
