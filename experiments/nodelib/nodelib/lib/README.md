We will look to package our node dependency as a package. Until then we ask you to either build it yourself or to
download https://praguenpm.blob.core.windows.net/files/node.zip and then extract the contents to this folder.

Build instructions can be found at https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/BUILDING.md. To build a shared library
you'll need to set a flag to the build script. For windows this can be done with `.\vcbuild.bat dll`.
