# Sprint 3

Sprint 3 will extend upon and showcase the infrastructure that was built during Sprint 2.

In sprint 2 we designed and implemented the merge tree instruction set that allows us to reach feature parity with Office.
We updated our storage model to be backed by Git. Giving us naming of all versions of a document as well as the ability
to branch and fork. Our intelligent service infrastructure was updated to be able to run on the client or the server. We 
added more intelligent services (spell checking) and updating our data types to support them. And we adopted Kubernetes
and Helm for service deployment.

These were major infrastructure updates but weren't always user visibile. Sprint 3 will further extend upon this infrastructure
but also more visibily expose it to users. We will take the merge tree instruction set and use it to build tables and
other rich text features. We will extend our branch/merge infrastructure to enable online, continuous integration merges
as well as offline merges. In doing so we will also build and explore the "higher plane" including a new set of intelligent
services that run on it and the combining of our text and ink canvases. We will build new data types (sets, counters, mutexes) on top of our underlying distributive data types. And will focus on engineering excellence by adding a robust set of stress, unit,
integration, and performance tests.

This sprint will run from September to October.
