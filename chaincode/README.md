# Chaincode

### What's a chaincode?
A chaincode is a installable block of code. They often create web components following the [Prague component model](../doc/architecture/web-component-model.md).

### How do I build a chaincode?
The easiest way to build a chaincode is to use [Yo Prague](../tools/generator-prague). We strongly suggest using Yo Prague as your starting point. For more exotic features, you can look through the examples in this directory.

### Troubleshooting
If you find a broken chaincode, feel free to fix it. We iterate on chaincode examples very quickly. The most recently updated chaincodes will always be working, but we don't guarentee updates to older chaincode.
