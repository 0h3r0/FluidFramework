# Scribe on Lambdas

As we begin to saturate the abilities of one webclient, we still haven't come near the limits of the service. Running individual authors as lambdas will give us much larger stress test capabilities.

## Working with Nuclio

Nuclio forces us to use handler.js as the entry file. With our current implementation, we only get one file as well...

## TODO
1. Actually do scribe stuff
2. Add logging
3. Add coordination abilities of HTTP
