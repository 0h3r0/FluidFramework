Prague is investigating and prototyping key design questions around interactive documents and MUIs.

The [server](./server) folder contains a set of legacy prototypes around a collaborative canvas. As well as MUIs that load within the browser or within an enlightened host.

[Routerlicious](./routerlicious) contains our latest prototype around new approaches to collaborative objects as well as a server backend to enable them with minimal COGS.

The other folders contain other prototypes that have exited during the project.
