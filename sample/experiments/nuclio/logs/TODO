Todays Notes
1. Let's get a demo wrapped...
2. Let's decide what the demo is
3. Let's get Daniel engaged
4. Look up RCS? IRC? 
    a. RCS = Rich Communication Services
    b. IRC = Internet Relay Chat
5. Let's get a stock market link going on...


Notes:
How to build a docker container in cluster... Docker sock kind of screws with this...
What's rbac? some sort of role based access control


Stock market link strategy...
1. "Request for Information" or does it listen to all ops?
    { Blob: helpNeeded }
2. "Writer... with a webhook"


Next Steps
1. Try to do a direct consumer... i.e. download and run off each op.
2. try to deploy using nuctl, perhaps that gives you more control?
