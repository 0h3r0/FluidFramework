    Options:
      --indir		            : name of the directory containing the output of the prague dumper tool
      --to					    : the last op number to be replayed
      --snapshot		        : will take snapshot after replaying all the ops(do not specify anything as value of this parameter)
      --snapfreq	            : n. A snapshot will be taken after every nth op.
      --outdir                  : name of the output directory where the snapshots will appear. If not specified a directory will
                                  be created in current directory with name "Output".
      --version                 : Name of the directory inside the --indir containing the snapshot blobs if you want to load the document from a 
                                  snapshot initially. 

## Example
    node .\dist\replayTool.js --filename messages.json --to 100 --snapfreq 20
    It will replay the ops from 0 to 100 and will take a snapshot after every 20th op and will write it in Output directory.

## Snapshot
    The snapshots will just appear in the --outdir in current directory. Filenames for snapshot will be like Snapshot_last_op_50.json and so on.
    The snapshot service will take snapshot for the individual components in the container and then the snapshot of the whole state will be taken.
    The snapshot for container will appear in --outdir/container and the snapshot for component will appear in --outdir/componentName/.
